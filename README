1、	it's similar to simDHT, https://github.com/laomayi/simDHT

2、	this project is written by QT 5.3 with mingW, while the simDHT written by python.

3、	I didn't test it enough, because it takes a lot of bandwidth. when I test it, my friends blame me, and force me to stop test.
	It seems to work well.

4、	It takes less memory than simDHT.
